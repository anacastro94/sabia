# Sabiá

This is a mobile app that aims to tackle the loneliness of older adults by enabling the exchange of audio stories between family and friends.

## Context

Loneliness is a familiar feeling for many older adults, and the number of seniors worldwide tends to increase yearly. Human beings are gregarious by nature. That is, it is part of human nature to participate in social groups, which is closely linked to the evolution of the species. In this way, the lack of social interaction can cause severe emotional problems, such as depression, and even lead to more tragic fates, such as suicide.
Some reasons for the decrease in the social contact of the elderly individual can be divided into three levels. The familiar one is that the children have grown up and have their own families and responsibilities; the cultural one is that there is little intergenerational contact, especially in Western societies; and the social one is that there is less responsibility from the community on older members.
In addition to the problems already mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another layer to the isolation of the older: health. Because they are the population most vulnerable to the virus, the older have had to submit to stricter isolation rules than the rest, aggravating the problem of loneliness among these individuals.
One of the possible solutions for this situation would be using digital technologies to facilitate contact with this group, which studies have shown to reduce stress and anxiety (Naeim et al., 2021). However, older people generally have little or no familiarity with new technologies. That is, they go through a process of double exclusion, not only in the real world but also in cyberspace.
Thus, a way to facilitate the interaction of the elderly public with new technologies can be through a design specifically made for the particular characteristics of this population. These characteristics can be physical, such as loss of visual acuity or decreased hearing capacity, and they can also be psychological, such as a greater fear of making mistakes when dealing with electronics and a feeling of frustration.

## Motivation

It is in the scenario described above that the Sabiá app was designed to increase the well-being of the population in question. There are three primary motivations for the creation of Sabiá.
The first is personal: I am a Brazilian immigrant in the United Kingdom, where I came to study for this MSc in Computer Science. I left all my family in Brazil: dog, sister, father, mother, and grandmother. My grandmother and I are very close, and I know she misses me as I miss her. As my grandmother is of age and entirely technologically illiterate, I have had difficulty communicating with her, which is the primary motivation for creating this application.
The second is social: Thinking about this issue, I realized that it was not just my grandmother who felt this way. And I decided to research more in-depth about loneliness in old age, from which the contextualization provided above comes. Also, the issue of COVID-19 was a remarkable experience for all the people who went through such a drastic global event, separating families worldwide.
The third is political: The president of Brazil at the time of writing this text is Jair Bolsonaro, an extreme right-wing politician who has ruled the country since 2019. The extreme right has taken possession of national symbols such as the flag, the colors green and yellow and the football team shirt. But there was still a national symbol that remained intact to this illegitimate appropriation: the Sabiá. Sabiá, in Tupi, a Brazilian indigenous language, means the one who prays a lot and is the bird symbol of my country.
A famous poem puts this bird as one of the main nostalgias of a Brazilian in foreign lands. For clarification, the poem makes more sense in Portuguese because it rhymes. 

_Exile song

My land has palm trees
Where the Sabiá sings,
The birds that chirp here,
They don't chirp like there.

Our sky has more stars,
Our floodplains have more flowers,
Our woods have more life,
Our life more loves.

In brooding, alone, at night,
More pleasure I find there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the Sabiá sings.

My land has primes,
What such I can't find here;
In brooding – alone, at night –
More pleasure I find there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the Sabiá sings.

God doesn't allow me to die,
Without my going back there;
Without enjoying the primes
That I can't find around here;
Without ever seeing the palm trees,
Where the Sabiá sings.

In short, Sabiá is a technical creation but also a social, political, and personal one. And as a developer, I hope it can represent hope for a more humane world, a more democratic Brazil and more integrated older individuals, including my grandmother.
